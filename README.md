Title: Netflix Clone Website - HTML/CSS Project

Description:
Welcome to my Netflix Clone Website project! This project is a demonstration of my skills in HTML and CSS, aiming to replicate the layout and design of the popular streaming platform, Netflix.

Features:

Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Customized Layout: I've carefully recreated the layout of Netflix, including the header, navigation bar, carousel for featured content, and grid layout for showcasing movies and TV shows.
CSS Styling: Leveraging CSS, I've added styles and animations to mimic the look and feel of Netflix, from hover effects on buttons to transitions between pages.
Static Content: This project focuses on front-end development, so the content is static. However, it provides a solid foundation for further development, including integrating dynamic data and functionality.
Educational Purpose: This project is not intended for commercial use but serves as a learning exercise for HTML and CSS enthusiasts, providing insights into modern web design practices.
Feel free to explore the code, make suggestions, or use it as a reference for your own projects. If you find this project helpful or have any feedback, don't hesitate to reach out! Happy coding! ðŸš€
